`word` requires perl to run; by default it also requires `wrap` (shipped
in this repository) to be on the path, and expects a dictionary at
`/usr/share/dict/words`.

Run `perldoc word` for documentation; run with `-f/path/to/dictionary`
to use a different dictionary; pipe the output to something to avoid
the dependency on `wrap`.

(More extensive README to be added later.)
